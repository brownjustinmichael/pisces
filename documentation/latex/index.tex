The goal of this project is to set up a code designed to do 2\-D Anelastic simulations using a spectral element scheme. Currently, the aim is do get the solution to the 1\-D advection-\/diffusion equation for a constant background flow.

Possible further reaching goals\-: 3\-D, pseudo-\/incompressible
